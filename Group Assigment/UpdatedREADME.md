# **Proposal 2: 206A Spatial Data Analysis Project**

## **Research Questions:**

* Is income/race correlated to higher rates of policing?
* Is income related to resources in the built environment (i.e., access to grocery stores, green/open space [or the lack thereof]) as well? And does access to or lack of access to these resources also correlate with higher rates of policing? 

# **Why it s important to us, why it matters to others, and what is at stake**

This research is of importance to me for many reasons. Growing up in Montebello and East Los Angeles, I quickly realized that as a community, we had different resources surrounding our community, especially when it came to healthy and fresh food options and access to open and green space. My parents luckily exposed my family to many places in Southern California, including more affluent communities that had increased access to resources, including beach cities like Santa Monica, which had a different type of grocery store compared to what we had back at home. Now as an adult I realize that this has to do with different demographics of a community and who is meant to be attracted by either type of grocery store. These characteristics include income, race, and maybe even education level. I also believe that this matters when you incorporate a policing approach and arrest data surrounding different types of communities and the access (or lack thereof) of resources that they have because you can see geographically how certain communities are targeted and policed at higher rates. I have personally experienced this and have had family members experience this as well, which is why there is a lot at stake when you are harassed,  interrogated, or even arrested for simply living

This research is important to me because growing up in South Central LA, I constantly witnessed how heavily policed my neighborhood was versus when I would visit my grandmother in Norwalk or went to school in Alhambra. Policing wasn’t something I saw on a daily basis when I was visiting other cities. As an organizer, we’d often take our students on a West LA vs. South LA tour to document any differences between the two areas (ie: the number of clinics vs hospitals, grocery stores vs liquor stores, banks vs. check-cashing services, etc).  and have students build an understanding of why these differences existed. As an adult, I understand that race and income play a lot into why these differences exist. Through this research, I want to be able to illustrate the concentrations of arrests and compare that to the amount of access to resources in the built environment these communities have. This is important because as we continue with COVID recovery efforts like relief funding and budget allocations, our findings can detail which areas across LA county can benefit from an increase in funding that goes towards community needs. And it can also highlight how policing of these areas also play a role in their development as well as their access to resources. 

# **Spatial Scope**

We plan to focus on West Los Angeles and South Central, LA as our spatial scope because it is local to us and both are very diverse communities within LA County which would allow us to explore similarities and differences of each community as it relates to income, race, access to resources and policing. 

# **Intended Analysis and Visualizations**

* We visualize a map focused on South Central and West LA showing clusters of high policing in moderate to low-income residential areas and areas where there are high concentrations of ethnic groups. We also hypothesize that there will be hot spots of policing in low-income areas that are expecting development/ gentrification.
* We hypothesize that there would be a strong correlation between higher rates of policing and moderate to low-income areas that are under-resourced or have accessibility issues to resources, such as grocery stores and green/ open space.

# **Expected Insights**

As I began my research and mapping for the grocery store data, I realized that there are a lot of grocery stores in the council districts of South Central (which I had not hypothesized). The difference that cannot necessarily be shown in mapping the points, and what makes qualitative data so important, is that a lot of the markets and grocery stores in the council districts that overlap with South Central is that they are smaller, family owned stores, unlike the larger chain markets we see on the Westside, like Trader Joe’s, Sprouts, etc. With more functions, I am sure mapping can show this difference, and with overlays of data from my partner’s work, such as the income as well as the arrest data, we can give more of a full picture with the graphics which portray what we expect: that as income decreases, arrests increase, access to resources (grocery stores and open parks) also decrease.

As I’ve started my research into median household income data, I’ve noticed a large dispersal of income inequality among areas like West LA and South Central area. I realized that most census tracts that fall within the South Central area have a lesser median household income than $50,000 (which is less than the median household income of LA County- $66,000 within the last year). And for census tracts that fall within the West LA Area, their median household income is actually higher than the 75th percentile at $90,000. I’m interested to see how this is correlated to higher rates of policing and access to parks and grocery stores.
