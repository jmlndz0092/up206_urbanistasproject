# **An introduction of your research question**
* Is income correlated to higher rates of policing?
* If there is a strong correlation, is it related to resources in the built environment (i.e., access to grocery stores, green/open space)

# **Why it is Important to Us, Why it Matters to Others, and What is at Stake?**
## Samantha Guerrero
This research is of importance to me for many reasons. Growing up in Montebello and East Los Angeles, I quickly realized that as a community, we had different resources surrounding our community, especially when it came to healthy and fresh food options and access to open and green space. My parents luckily exposed my family to many places in Southern California, including more affluent communities that had increased access to resources, including beach cities like Santa Monica, which had a different type of grocery store compared to what we had back at home. Now as an adult I realize that this has to do with different demographics of a community and who is meant to be attracted by either type of grocery store. These characteristics include income, race, and maybe even education level. I also believe that this matters when you incorporate a policing approach and arrest data surrounding different types of communities and the access (or lack thereof) of resources that they have because you can see geographically how certain communities are targeted and policed at higher rates. I have personally experienced this and have had family members experience this as well, which is why there is a lot at stake when you are harassed,  interrogated, or even arrested for simply living. 

## Jessica Melendez 
This research is important to me because growing up in South Central LA, I constantly witnessed how heavily policed my neighborhood was versus when I would visit my grandmother in Norwalk or went to school in Alhambra. Policing wasn’t something I saw on a daily basis when I was visiting other cities. As an organizer, we’d often take our students on a West LA vs. South LA tour to document any differences between the two areas (ie: the number of clinics vs hospitals, grocery stores vs liquor stores, banks vs. check-cashing services, etc).  and have students build an understanding of why these differences existed. As an adult, I understand that race and income play a lot into why these differences exist. Through this research, I want to be able to illustrate the concentrations of arrests and compare that to the amount of access to resources in the built environment these communities have. This is important because as we continue with COVID recovery efforts like relief funding and budget allocations, our findings can detail which areas across LA county can benefit from an increase in funding that goes towards community needs. And it can also highlight how policing of these areas also play a role in their development as well as their access to resources. 

# **Spatial scope and why Space and/or Time Matters** 
We plan to focus on LA County as our spatial scope because it is local to us and big in space, which would allow us to find the comparisons we hope to assess. LA County is a large enough space to where we can compare several cities or neighborhoods and see what similarities or differences arise. It is also important to note that as we continue with COVID recovery efforts and as relief continues to make its way down to communities, this data can indicate patterns and trends worth noting when thinking about equity and relief.

# **Intended Analysis and Resulting Visualizations**

# **Insights and Expectations**
A map of LA County showing clusters of high policing in moderate to low-income residential areas. We also hypothesize that there will be hot spots of policing in low-income areas that are expecting development/ gentrification. 
We hypothesize that there would be a strong correlation between higher rates of policing and moderate to low-income areas that are under-resourced or have accessibility issues to resources, such as grocery stores and green/ open space.
